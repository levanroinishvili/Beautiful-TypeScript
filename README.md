## About this Repo

Solving these problems are fun but useful. What else could a developer want? If we can spend 15 minutes relaxing with a nice challenge, that is a reward in itself. And, perhaps we can be better prepared for the next interview.

I have sat many times on both sides of a software interview. As a contractor, I have been interviewed more times than I care to remember. I must admit, not all the interviews were successful. I have also interviewed other developers, sometimes much better developers than myself - which incidentally are my favorate memories.

But my role would have been enhanced at every single one of these interviews, if I had tackled these simple questions beforehand.

## About Me

My background is in mathematics. I do not have a degree in computer science. So, don't be surprised if I suddenly call an Array "a bunch of numbers".

## About Life

So, have fun and good luck on your next interview. I hope you wish me luck too.
