## Probelm Statement

Given an array of integers `numbers` that is already ***sorted in non-decreasing order***, find two elements that add up to a given `target`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, where both indeces are 1-based indeces.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.
