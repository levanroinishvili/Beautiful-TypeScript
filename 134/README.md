## Probelm Statement

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `i`th station to `i`ts next `(i + 1)`th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`.

If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
